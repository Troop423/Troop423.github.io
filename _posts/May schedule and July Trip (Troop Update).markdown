In an attempt  to get a destination event on your calendars, we have booked campsites 43,44,45 and 49 (they are side by side) at Susquehannock Campground at Raystown Lake.  Arrival time is after 5 on Thursday 7/28 with a return home on Sunday 7/31.    http://www.recreation.gov/camping/susquehannock/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=73431
 
As of now we have Mikey, Kyle, Jerrett, Ryan and the Jacobs and Koch brothers as well as some of the new guys.
