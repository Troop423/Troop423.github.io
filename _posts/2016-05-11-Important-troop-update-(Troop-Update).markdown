I need summer camp final payments $255 by 5/18 to take advantage of the early bird price.  Fee goes up $20 if not paid by 5/20.
Raystown lake trip 7/28-7/31 – last call to commit as I hope to be making reservations soon. 

Meeting Sunday at 6:30 in the grove. 

Any interest in the HMC night at the Fightin Phils 6/10 or Blue Marsh Lake’s Get Outdoors Day 6/11 – note that HMC is looking for a knot display and staffing for a station.

Note that 6/10 was a night we had identified as a possible campout at Davis.
